# Week 1: Python for Finance Basics - S&P 500 Analysis Report

## Overview

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of S&P 500 historical data using Python for finance. The analysis covers data retrieval, processing, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques fundamental to quantitative finance.

## Objectives

- Learn essential Python libraries for financial analysis
- Download and process historical stock market data
- Calculate key financial metrics and indicators
- Create meaningful visualizations for data interpretation

## Required Libraries and Setup

### Dependencies

```python
# Required libraries installation
# pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy yfinance

import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Core Libraries Used

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **yfinance**: Yahoo Finance API for downloading historical data
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization and plotting
- **numpy**: Numerical computations (implicit dependency)
- **scipy**: Scientific computing (as mentioned in requirements)

## Data Acquisition

### Dataset

- **Symbol**: ^GSPC (S&P 500 Index)
- **Time Period**: January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2025 (5 years)
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance via yfinance library

### Data Download Process

```python
# Download S&P 500 historical data
sp500 = yf.download("^GSPC", start="2020-01-01", end="2025-01-01",
                    auto_adjust=True, progress=False)
```

**Key Parameters:**

- `auto_adjust=True`: Automatically adjusts prices for splits and dividends
- `progress=False`: Disables download progress bar for cleaner output

## Data Exploration and Analysis

### Basic Data Inspection

The analysis begins with fundamental data exploration:

- **Head inspection**: First 5 rows examination
- **Data info**: Column types, null values, memory usage
- **Descriptive statistics**: Mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles

### Calculated Metrics and Indicators

#### 1. Daily Returns

```python
sp500['DailyReturn'] = sp500['Close'].pct_change()
```

- Measures day-to-day percentage change in closing prices
- Essential for risk and volatility analysis

#### 2. Rolling Statistics (20-day window)

```python
sp500['rollingMean'] = sp500['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
sp500['rollingStd'] = sp500['Close'].rolling(window=20).std()
```

- **Rolling Mean**: 20-day moving average for trend identification
- **Rolling Standard Deviation**: Volatility measure over 20-day periods

#### 3. Short-term Indicators (3-day window)

```python
sp500['sliceOpen'] = sp500['Open'].rolling(window=3).mean()
sp500['sliceHigh'] = sp500['High'].rolling(window=3).mean()
sp500['sliceLow'] = sp500['Low'].rolling(window=3).mean()
sp500['sliceVolume'] = sp500['Volume'].rolling(window=3).mean()
sp500['sliceDailyReturn'] = sp500['DailyReturn'].rolling(window=3).mean()
```

- 3-day moving averages across all OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data
- Smoothed daily returns for short-term trend analysis

#### 4. Extremes Analysis

```python
sp500['topReturn'] = sp500['DailyReturn'].rolling(window=3).max()
sp500['bottomReturn'] = sp500['DailyReturn'].rolling(window=3).min()
```

- Maximum and minimum returns within 3-day rolling windows
- Useful for identifying short-term volatility spikes

## Visualization and Insights

### 1. Comprehensive Rolling Averages Plot

- **Purpose**: Visualize all calculated metrics simultaneously
- **Features**:
  - All rolling averages on a single plot
  - 14x7 figure size for detailed analysis
  - Legend positioned at upper left
  - Date-indexed time series

### 2. Daily Returns Time Series

- **Focus**: S&P 500 daily return patterns over time
- **Insights**: Volatility clusters, market stress periods
- **Figure Size**: 12x6 for optimal viewing

### 3. Returns Distribution Histogram

- **Analysis**: Statistical distribution of daily returns
- **Configuration**: 50 bins for detailed distribution shape
- **Purpose**: Assess normality, identify outliers, measure skewness

### 4. Price with Volatility Bands

- **Components**:
  - Daily returns line plot
  - 20-day rolling mean overlay
  - Volatility bands (Â±1 standard deviation)
- **Features**:
  - Gray shaded area representing volatility bands
  - 20% transparency for clear underlying data visibility
  - Combined trend and risk visualization

## Key Financial Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. **Risk and Return Analysis**

- Daily return calculations as foundation of risk metrics
- Rolling statistics for dynamic risk assessment
- Distribution analysis for understanding return patterns

### 2. **Technical Analysis Foundations**

- Moving averages for trend identification
- Volatility bands for risk assessment
- Rolling windows for adaptive indicators

### 3. **Data Processing Techniques**

- Time series data handling with pandas
- Missing data considerations (pct_change creates NaN for first observation)
- Multi-column calculations and transformations

### 4. **Visualization Best Practices**

- Multiple plot types for different insights
- Appropriate figure sizing for readability
- Legend placement and transparency usage
- Meaningful titles and axis labels

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Structure

- **Index**: DatetimeIndex (daily frequency)
- **Columns**: OHLCV + calculated indicators
- **Data Types**: Float64 for price/return data

### Performance Considerations

- Rolling calculations are computationally efficient with pandas
- Auto-adjustment eliminates need for manual dividend/split handling
- Progress bar disabled for cleaner notebook execution

### Error Handling

- `pct_change()` automatically handles missing data
- Rolling calculations handle insufficient data at series start
- Yahoo Finance API provides robust data with automatic error handling
