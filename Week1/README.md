# Week 1: Python for Finance Basics – S&P 500 Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates foundational Python skills for quantitative finance by analyzing the S&P 500 index. You will learn to acquire, process, and visualize financial data using industry-standard libraries.

## Project Structure

- `Week1_PythonBasics_S&P500.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with step-by-step analysis and visualizations
- `week-1.py` – Python script version of the analysis
- `Week1_Analysis_Report.md` – Detailed technical report
- `Week1_Summary.md` – Concise summary of the project and results

## Key Libraries

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- yfinance

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy yfinance
   ```

2. Open the notebook (`Week1_PythonBasics_S&P500.ipynb`) in Jupyter or VS Code and run all cells, or run the script (`week-1.py`) in your Python environment.

## Analysis Highlights

- Downloaded S&P 500 historical data (2020–2025) from Yahoo Finance
- Calculated daily returns, rolling means, and volatility
- Visualized price trends, return distributions, and volatility bands
- Explored key financial and data science concepts

## Learning Outcomes

- Data acquisition and cleaning for financial time series
- Calculation of returns and rolling statistics
- Visualization of trends and risk metrics
- Application of Python for real-world finance problems

## Next Steps

- Add more technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD)
- Compare multiple indices or assets
- Explore portfolio and risk analysis
