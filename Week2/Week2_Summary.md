# Week 2 Summary: Probability, Statistics & Portfolio Analysis

## Overview

This week focused on applying probability and statistics to stock market data, with an emphasis on portfolio theory. Using Python, you explored daily returns, risk, correlation, and the efficient frontier for a selection of major stocks.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Daily Returns & Volatility:** Calculated and visualized daily and annualized returns and risk for individual stocks.
- **Portfolio Construction:** Created random portfolios, computed expected return and volatility, and visualized risk-return tradeoffs.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Used heatmaps to explore relationships between stock returns.
- **Efficient Frontier:** Simulated thousands of portfolios to visualize the efficient frontier and identify the optimal risk-return combination.

## Tools & Libraries

- `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation and statistics
- `yfinance` for financial data acquisition
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization

## Main Files

- `Week2_Probability_Statistics_Stocks.ipynb`: Core notebook for risk-return and correlation analysis.
- `Week2_efficient_frontier.ipynb`: Efficient frontier simulation and visualization.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understand and compute key portfolio statistics (mean, covariance, correlation).
- Visualize and interpret risk-return profiles and the efficient frontier.
- Apply Python to real-world portfolio optimization problems.
